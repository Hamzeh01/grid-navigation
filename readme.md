# Grid Traversal Algorithms

## Description

Grid Traversal is a web application that helps users find the shortest path in a grid using A\* or Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS) algorithms. Users can upload a grid file, specify start and end points, select the algorithm, and find the shortest path.

## Live Demo

Check out the live demo [here](https://hamzeh01.github.io/grid-navigation/).

## Features

- Upload a grid file.
- Specify start and end points.
- Choose between A\* and GBFS algorithms.
- Display the shortest path, cost, and runtime.

   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd grid-navigation
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Usage

1. Upload a grid file (e.g., `grid.txt`).
2. Specify the start and end points.
3. Select the desired algorithm (A\* or GBFS).
4. Click the "Find Path" button to compute the shortest path.
5. The output section will display the path, cost, and runtime.
